**What are Compound AI Systems?**  
Compound AI systems are a new approach in AI that brings together different models, tools, and techniques to solve complex problems. Instead of relying on just one model, these systems combine multiple components to make the whole system stronger and more adaptable, especially when dealing with real-world challenges.

**What are AI Agents?**  
AI agents are programs that can act on their own, making decisions and taking actions in both real and virtual environments. They can set goals, plan how to achieve them, and learn from what they do, which makes them useful in tasks that need real-time decision-making and adaptability.

**What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?**  
Compound AI systems are like the brains behind AI agents. They provide the intelligence and decision-making power that allows AI agents to work on their own. By using multiple AI components together, these systems help AI agents handle more complicated tasks and make smarter decisions.

**What is the difference between Fine-Tuning and RAG?**  
Fine-tuning is when you take an existing AI model and adjust it by training it on specific data to make it better at a particular task. RAG, or Retrieval-Augmented Generation, works differently. It pulls in real-time information from external sources to help the AI model generate more accurate and relevant answers, without needing to retrain the model.
